# Screeps
My Defensive Screeps Codes

Roles:

Harvester -> which supplies energy to Town(Spawn), Spawn Extensions and Towers but when they are full, it switches the role to the Carrier which carries energy source to Upgrader storage.

Carrier -> They have only one job which is carry energy from specific container( Down) to the Upgrader Storage.

Upgrader -> They are upgrading Room Controller constantly and harvest energy from the storage which is specifically located for them.

Repairer -> They are repairing every structures but also work as builder when there is nothing to repair.

Miner -> Miners are located near to the energy sources, they have containers under them. Since they have no carry body, they drops the energy directly to the containers. That provides time efficiency in harvesting for other creeps. The body part of miners are specifically calculated for regeneration of energy sources.

Wall Repairer -> They are specifically repairs walls and ramparts and also works as builder when there is no wall or rampart to repair.

Builder -> They are building structures but also works as upgrader when there is nothing to build.
Attacker is currently under development :)
